patient here for renal ultrasound because of hematuria . urine dipstick today . negative for leukocytes , nitrates , protein , ketone , bilirubin and glucose . color yellow and clear , urobilinogen 0.2 , ph 5.5 and specific gravity 1.020 . there is a trace amount of blood in the urine and intact . renal ultrasound impression . right kidney is 10 cm in length by five centimeter wide . there are no stones , masses or hydronephrosis . the left kidney is 10.8 centimeters in length and five centimeters wide . there is a six millimeter left renal stone non-obstructing . 533 milliliters pre-void and 0 milliliters post-void . hi , mrs. wood . i see you're just finished your ultrasound .\\n[patient] yes , ma'am .\\n[doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .\\n[patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .\\n[doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .\\n[patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .\\n[doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?\\n[patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .\\n[doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?\\n[patient] that's right .\\n[doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .\\n[patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .\\n[doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .\\n[patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .\\n[doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .\\n[patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?\\n[doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .\\n[patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?\\n[doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .\\n[patient] what's oxalate ?\\n[doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .\\n[patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .\\n[doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .\\n[patient] okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help me remember .\\n[doctor] perfect . well , if you have any more questions . if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set . i wo n't need to see you back until next year , as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner . and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room .\\n[patient] all right . well , let's hope we do n't have to do either of those and i see you next year .\\n[doctor] yes , let's hope . come right this way and i'll walk you to check out . update pe abdomen . no flank pain . anti gu . normal vaginal exam . primary diagnosis is hematuria . secondary diagnosis is chronic urol ... urolithiasis . thank you . this completes mrs. wood encounter .\",\n          \"[doctor] so stephanie morales is a 36 -year-old female today complaining of her ankle pain and she also has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure so stephanie tell me what's going on with your ankle\\n[patient] well we had a long spring and the other day we got some snow and ice i

ago okay and so it's your left ankle and it kinda just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside\\n[patient] yeah more on the it's more on the outside of my hips\\n[doctor] and did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself\\n[patient] no i fell\\n[doctor] okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up\\n[patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk\\n[doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that\\n[patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation\\n[doctor] okay has that helped much or not really\\n[patient] a little bit\\n[doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all\\n[patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle\\n[doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably\\n[patient] yeah it's swollen but no bleeding\\n[doctor] well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that\\n[patient] no they've been pretty stable\\n[doctor] okay\\n[patient] so with my diet\\n[doctor] good\\n[patient] so\\n[doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well\\n[patient] yes\\n[doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six . eight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no\\n[patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks\\n[doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that\\n[patient] i have an appointment\\n[doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything\\n[patient] i need a refill on that yes\\n[doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you\\n[patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so\\n[doctor] okay\\n[patient] thank you\\n[doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you

trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt\\n[doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go\\n[patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable\\n[doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain\\n[patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours\\n[doctor] alright and and did that help\\n[patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain\\n[doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you\\n[patient] yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me\\n[doctor] yeah what what are you doing with your basement are

all\\n[patient] so do you think this pain will ever go away\\n[doctor] now well many patients are very successful with the physical therapy those will those help strengthen you know they do a lot of

The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago. He denies any specific injury. The patient states he is active and has been renovating his basement. He reports a history of intermittent aches and pains in his left shoulder. He has difficulty reaching for or lifting any objects. He adds that he avoids reaching overhead secondary to the pain. The patient describes his pain as constant and worsening. He notes his pain is unbearable when lying on his left shoulder at night. He denies any numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities. He has been taking 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every 6 to 8 hours, which provides some relief.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\\n\\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.

I will also refer him to formal physical therapy to strengthen his left shoulder for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. The patient was provided with educational materials regarding expectations related to his physical therapy. He may continue to take Tylenol as needed. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, we will consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

will start naprosyn mg twice daily for pain control continue with ice and elevation diabetes type medical reasoning this appears to be well controlled with her current regimen patient education and counseling encouraged her to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for her diabetic eye exam medical treatment we will keep her on her current dose of metformin and order repeat hemoglobin we will also obtain set of baseline labs hypertension medical reasoning she is doing well with norvasc patient education and counseling encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and knows to contact the office if needed medical treatment we will keep her on her current dose of norvasc refill was sent for this today patient agreements the patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan eostok\",\n          \"sostok chief complaint left shoulder pain history of present illness wayne taylor is pleasant year old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain the onset of his pain began weeks ago he denies any specific injury the patient states he is active and has been renovating his basement he reports history of intermittent aches and pains in his left shoulder he has difficulty reaching for or lifting any objects he adds that he avoids reaching overhead secondary to the pain the patient describes his pain as constant and worsening he notes his pain is unbearable when lying on his left shoulder at night he denies any numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities he has been taking extra strength tylenol every to hours which provides some relief review of systems musculoskeletal reports left shoulder pain neurological denies numbness or tingling in the bilateral upper extremities vitals all vital signs are within the normal limits physical exam capillary refill is less than seconds neuro normal sensation sensation is intact to light touch in the left upper extremity msk examination of the left shoulder limited active and passive rom tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints good hand grip results rays of the left shoulder were obtained and are reviewed today these reveal there are no fractures assessment left shoulder pain most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy plan after reviewing the patient examination and radiographic findings today have had lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms have explained to him that his symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy recommend obtaining an mri of the left shoulder to further assess the rotator cuff will also refer him to formal physical therapy to strengthen his left shoulder for approximately to weeks the patient was provided with educational materials regarding expectations related to his physical therapy he may continue to take tylenol as needed if his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy we will consider steroid injection to the left shoulder all questions were answered instructions the patient will follow up with me after he has completed his course of physical therapy eostok\"\n        ],\n
